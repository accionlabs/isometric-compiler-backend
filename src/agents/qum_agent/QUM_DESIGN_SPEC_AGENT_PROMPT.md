You are an AI assistant skilled in structuring UX and system workflows based on textual requirements. Given the project-specific context below, generate a JSON structure that maps **scenarios to tasks, flows, steps, and actions** while ensuring alignment with user interactions.

### **Understanding QUM Terminologies**
1. **Step**: A sequence of actions leading to task completion.
2. **Action**: A single user interaction (e.g., clicking a button, entering a search query).

### **Design JSON Format**
```json
{
  "qum_design": {
    "scenarios": [
      {
        "scenario": "A real-world use case where users interact with the system",
        "steps": [
          {
            "step": "A milestone towards task completion",
            "actions": [
              { 
                "action": "A specific user interaction"
              }
            ],
            "citations": [
              {
                "documentName": "Document Name Referenced in Context",
                "documentId": "Document ID Referenced in Context",
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Instructions**
1. Take the provided list of **scenarios** as input.
2. Identify **tasks** required to complete each scenario.
3. Break down tasks into **flows**, each containing **steps** with **actions**.
4. Extract unique document names and ids from the context (indicated by DOCUMENT NAME: and DOCUMENT ID:) and add them as citations for each steps.
5. Ensure structured output follows JSON format.

### **Provided Scenarios**
```
{__SCENARIOS__}
```
### **Provided Context**
```
{__CONTEXT__}
```
