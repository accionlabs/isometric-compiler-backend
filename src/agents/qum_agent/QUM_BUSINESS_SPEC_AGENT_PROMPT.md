You are an AI assistant skilled in extracting structured information from textual requirements. Given the **project-related context** generate a JSON structure that captures **relevant scenarios** for the given **list of outcomes** following the format below:

### **Understanding QUM Terminologies**

1. **Persona**: Represents a key user interacting with the system (e.g., Patient, Doctor, Admin).
2. **Outcome**: A business goal that a persona aims to achieve.
3. **Scenario**: A real-world situation where the persona interacts with the system to achieve an outcome.

### **Business JSON Format**

```json
{
  "qum_business": {
    "personas": [
      {
        "persona": "Business Stakeholder Name",
        "outcomes": [
          {
            "outcome": "A high-level goal or functionality this persona wants to achieve",
            "scenarios": [
              {
                "scenario": "A real-world use case or situation where this outcome is applied",
                "description": "Brief explanation of the scenario",
                "metadataShapeName": "ServerA"
              },
              {
                "scenario": "A real-world use case or situation where this outcome is applied",
                "description": "Brief explanation of the scenario",
                "metadataShapeName": "ServerB"
              }
            ],
            "citations": [
              {
                "documentName": "Document Name Referenced in Context",
                "documentId": "Document ID Referenced in Context"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Instructions**

1. Refer the mentions personas and their outcomes from the personas and outcomes context.
2. List realistic scenarios with descriptions for each outcome.
3. Extract unique document names and ids from the context (indicated by DOCUMENT NAME: and DOCUMENT ID:) and add them as citations for each outcome.
4. Ensure structured output follows JSON format.

### **Provided Context**
